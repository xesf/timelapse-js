# timelapse-js
Timelapse JS is a small tool to view and create timelapse videos without the need to have complex paid software.

This project aims to facilitate the creation of timelapse image sequence with posibility of exporting to a video.

Since I don't have the energy to post-process all my timelapses, and it's time consuming, I though about creating this little tool to visualise how timelapse will look like without paying for other known tools.
